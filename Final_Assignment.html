                <p>
                    I was born in Dharwad, Karnatka India. It is a university town and known as educational capital. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My father was a Civil Engineer with State Government, so we got to see a new place every three years courtesy Tax Payers' money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I have lived and gown up in Gadag, Haveri, Belgaum, Mysore, Bangalore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first job was in Pune Maharastra India.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    After couple of years I moved to Bangalore so that I could be with my parents and started working there.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Then I moved to Mysore as I was tasked with leading a team based out of Mysore.
                </p>    
                <p>    
                    From Mysore I came to US and have been in the US since then.
                </p>
